# Section 3: Getting started with AWS

## 8. AWS Cloud Overview - Regions & AZ

### References

- [Regions, AZs](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)

### Regions

- AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers.
- We call each group of logical data centers an **Availability Zone**.
- Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZs within a geographic area.

### Availability Zones

- An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, 
networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region.
- AZs give customers the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, 
fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center.
